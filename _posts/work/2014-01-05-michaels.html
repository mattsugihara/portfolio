	<h2>Sample Deliverables</h2>
	<p>
		Though the site is responsive, we designed the site using a series of static example wireframes at various resolutions. For <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/responsive-strategy/#mobile-first">many reasons</a>, we took a mobile&#8210;first approach to design. This helped the team to stay focused on delivering the best experience to the end user, regardless of device.

	</a>
	<p>
		While the platform (Demandware) didn't (still doesn't) support progressive enhancement, we took care to ensure that, to the extent that was possible, users were not penalized for using any particular device. Where possible though, we leveraged device capabilities to improve the experience of using the site.

	<p>
		Because the project changed so rapidly, we annotated the final comps, rather than wireframes, to ensure that the functionality matched the visual design presented to the engineering team.
