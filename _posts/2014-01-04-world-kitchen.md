		<h2>Sample Deliverables</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="large-4 push-8 columns">
		<p>
			Though the site was to become the "digital flagship" for World Kitchen's brands, it could not damage any of the deep ties World Kitchen had created with retailers like like Walmart and Target.
			To accomplish this, we recommended that World Kitchen focus on delivering content that only they could deliver.
		</p>
		<p>
			Early in discovery, we identified that despite being popular with an older demographic, many of the brands, particularly Pyrex and Corelle, had significatn activity on Instagram and Twitter. Knowing this, we helped World Kitchen to leverage that activity and show it directly on the site.
