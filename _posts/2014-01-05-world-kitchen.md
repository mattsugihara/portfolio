	<div class="large-4 push-8 columns">
		<p>
			While this site would function as a "digital flagship" for the brands, the client had deep ties with existing retailers that it wished to protect. To accomplish this, we recommended against holding sales and always pricing products at MSRP, and made it easy for customers to find retailers (both on and off line) where they might be able to find the product more cheaply.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, to make purchasing directly from the brand seem special, we created several modules for displaying content on the various pages on the site. This would help communicate the value of the product to the customers and encourage them to buy direct.
