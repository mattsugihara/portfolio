			<a href="http://www.worldkitchen.com/">World Kitchen</a> approached Fluid to design and build a unified, custom Demandware store front from which to sell products from each of their six brands (Corelle, Pyrex, Conringware, Chicago Cutlery, Snapwear and Baker's Secret). The crux of the project was creating a design system that would allow each brand to give their customers a strongly branded experience within the frame work of a unified design system.
		</p>
		<p class="lede">
			To accomplish this, we leveraged atomic design to provide each brandwith a kit of modules that they could use to build page templates that suited their individual needs. This ensured an extremely managable site that still fit the dissimilar requirements of each brand.

			While this site would function as a "digital flagship" for the brands, the client had deep ties with existing retailers that it wished to protect. To accomplish this, we recommended against holding sales and always pricing products at MSRP, and made it easy for customers to find retailers (both on and off line) where they might be able to find the product more cheaply.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, to make purchasing directly from the brand seem special, we created several modules for displaying content on the various pages on the site. This would help communicate the value of the product to the customers and encourage them to buy direct.
