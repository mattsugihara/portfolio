## Ingredients
 - 1 Qt. **low sodium** chicken broth
 - 1 inch fresh ginger
 - 4 cloves garlic (2 cloves for the stock, 2 for garnish)
 - 3 ounces smoky slab Bacon
 - 2" piece of lemongrass stalk
 - 2 package of ramen noodles (toss the soup packet)
 - 2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
 - 1 tablespoon black vinegar
 - 1 egg
 - 1 handful chopped scallions
 - 1 handful julienned mustard greens, baby spinach leaves, or kale

## Instructions
1. Place stock, bacon, ginger, garlic, and lemongrass in a pot. Simmer for 30 to 45 minutes.
2. In a separate small pot, bring water to a boil. Poke a small hole in the large end of the egg and soft boil the egg (between 6 and 7 minutes). Shell the egg under cold water. Once shelled, marinate in soy sauce. (Or [do this](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/ajitsuke-tamago-japanese-marinated-soft-boiled-egg-recipe.html) before hand if you're not into the whole last minute thing.)
3. Remove bacon, lemongrass, and ginger from the stock. Reserve the bacon for later.
4. Add in greens (unless using baby spinach), soy sauce, and vinegar. Taste and check for salt, then add salt and pepper to taste.
5. Slice the bacon. Add sliced garlic cloves to a pan with the bacon, and fry both until crisp.
6. Cook the ramen. 
7. Place ramen noodles (and baby spinach if using) in a bowl. Pour the broth over the noodles, then garnish with bacon, eggs, fried garlic, and scallions.
